# Multi-Stimuli

This project is compatible for the Neural Circuit Assembly Laboratory at UZH. It is used for in vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal networks in rats, aiming to generate more than one kind of stimulus at the same time.
Our work is aimed at understanding how the environment moulds the construction and reconfiguration of neuronal circuits to allow them to effectively process and respond to external stimuli throughout development.
